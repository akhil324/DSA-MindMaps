### A Visual Journey to Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome! This repository is designed to be your one-stop, visual guide to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. Forget dry, dense textbooks. Here, we learn by seeing, connecting, and building‚Äîjust like a real architect.

Our mission is to transform complex DSA concepts into clear, interconnected mind maps and provide targeted practice to help you build a strong foundation for acing coding interviews and writing brilliant code.

### The Journey: A Three-Part Plan

This repository is structured in three simple, progressive parts. Follow them in order to go from apprentice to master.

#### **Part 1: The Foundation & The Blueprints**
Before you can build, you must learn the principles. This section covers the absolute essentials: what DSA is, why it matters, and how we measure the quality of our work (Big O Notation).

#### **Part 2: The Core Toolkit**
This section is your toolbox, filled with the fundamental data structures (the materials) and the core algorithms (the tools) you'll use to construct solutions.

#### **Part 3: The Strategic Playbook & The Drill**
This is where you learn and practice master techniques. We explore powerful problem-solving patterns and then test your recognition skills with a curated list of problems. This is your guide to strategy, advanced designs, and acing the interview.
